# Project5-EvanFodemski
Evan Fodemski fifth DU project

## Description 
In this project I created a work day scheduler that uses local storage to save information where it is written, dayjs for time, and to create a variable relative to that time, so the color of the description box changes accordingly to if it is in the past, present, or future.
